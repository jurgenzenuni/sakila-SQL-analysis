# Sakila Database Analysis Project

# Overview 

This project involves analyzing the Sakila database to gain actionable insights into the movie rental business's performance and customer behavior. I wrote SQL queries to answer specific business questions and generate detailed reports, which were then visualized using Tableau.

- Queries Constructed for analysis are included in the analysis.sql file, some were used for general information and others marked with *'s were used as direct data sources for visualizations.
# Objectives

- Revenue Analysis: Calculate total revenue generated by rentals, identify monthly revenue, and determine the highest-grossing months.
- Top-Performing Films: Identify the most/least popular films based on rental revenue and assess their rental frequency. The same should also be done for genre, including the differences in "Customer Preference" between the different store locations.
- Rental Trends: Analyze rental trends by genre, film rating, and rental duration, and determine the most rented films per store location.
- Store Performance: Compare revenue and rental activity across stores to assess store-level performance and identify areas for improvement.
- Customer Statistics: Segment customers based on rental activity, spending habits, and location to understand customer preferences and prioritize marketing efforts. Focusing on identifying popular films and genres per customer.
