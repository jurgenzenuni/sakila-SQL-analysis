# Sakila Database Analysis Project

# Overview 

This project involves analyzing the Sakila database to gain actionable insights into the movie rental business's performance and customer behavior. I wrote SQL queries to answer specific business questions and generate detailed reports, which were visualized using Tableau dashboards. Check out the Sakila Dashboard here:

# Objectives

Revenue Analysis: Calculate total revenue generated by rentals, identify monthly revenue trends, and determine the highest-grossing months.
Top-Performing Films: Identify the top 5 and bottom 5 movies based on rental revenue and assess their rental frequency.
Customer Behavior: Track new customer acquisition by analyzing how many new customers joined each year, calculate the average spending per customer, and identify top customer segments by revenue.
Rental Trends: Analyze rental trends by genre, film rating (e.g., PG, R), and rental duration, and determine the 2 most rented films per store location.
Store Performance: Compare revenue and rental activity across stores to assess store-level performance and identify areas for improvement.
Staff Performance: Evaluate staff performance by determining the number of rentals processed by each staff member and calculating the average revenue generated per staff.
Customer Segmentation: Segment customers based on rental activity, spending habits, and location to understand customer preferences and prioritize marketing efforts.
Inventory Insights: Assess the inventory turnover by identifying underperforming genres or films that are rarely rented.
