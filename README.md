# Sakila Database Analysis Project

# Overview 

This project involves analyzing the Sakila database to gain actionable insights into the movie rental business's performance and customer behavior. I wrote SQL queries to answer specific business questions and generate detailed reports, which were visualized using Tableau dashboards.

# Objectives

- Revenue Analysis: Calculate total revenue generated by rentals, identify monthly revenue trends, and determine the highest-grossing months.

- Top-Performing Films: Identify the top 5 and bottom 5 movies based on rental revenue and assess their rental frequency.
- Rental Trends: Analyze rental trends by genre, film rating (e.g., PG, R), and rental duration, and determine the 2 most rented films per store location.
- Store Performance: Compare revenue and rental activity across stores to assess store-level performance and identify areas for improvement.
- Customer Segmentation: Segment customers based on rental activity, spending habits, and location to understand customer preferences and prioritize marketing efforts.
- Inventory Insights: Assess the inventory turnover by identifying underperforming genres or films that are rarely rented.
